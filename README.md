# Divvy Pagerank

This repo take data from the Chicago bike sharing company Divvy and uses the pagerank graph algorithm to determine which stations rank highest.

Each station acts as a node, and each ride is an edge. The csv file from Divvy contains from_station and to_station information.

This project will also be flexible enough to run the pagerank algorithm based on date information or rider demographics.
